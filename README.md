For my final assignment it was most definitely a fun challenge.
I started out by creating the mobile layout for my website.
The first problem I encountered was the fact that my original mobile mockup had a hamburger drop down menu which we hadn't learned to do yet, so I opted to create a stacked list of nav items instead, placing my logo on the right side of the header with the navigation menu on the left.

I managed to sort through most problems through trial and error. But I've come to the realization I really don't understand the fundamentals of images and how to make them responsive. I'm going to take some time over the summer break to read up about image optimization so I have a better understanding on it for the future.
I was able to closely resemble my version to the mockup, but feel as though the design gets kind of messy throughout the changing of screen sizes. If you have the time to briefly make me aware of what I should read up on over the break regarding this it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for everything that you taught us this semester, I hope you have an enjoyable summer break. Hope you stay healthy and well.
